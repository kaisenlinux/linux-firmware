 *
 *  First, the polynomial itself and its table of feedback terms.  The
 *  polynomial is
 *  X^32+X^26+X^23+X^22+X^16+X^12+X^11+X^10+X^8+X^7+X^5+X^4+X^2+X^1+X^0
 *
 *  Note that we take it "backwards" and put the highest-order term in
 *  the lowest-order bit.  The X^32 term is "implied"; the LSB is the
 *  X^31 term, etc.  The X^0 term (usually shown as "+1") results in
 *  the MSB being 1
 *
 *  Note that the usual hardware shift register implementation, which
 *  is what we're using (we're merely optimizing it by doing eight-bit
 *  chunks at a time) shifts bits into the lowest-order term.  In our
 *  implementation, that means shifting towards the right.  Why do we
 *  do it this way?  Because the calculated CRC must be transmitted in
 *  order from highest-order term to lowest-order term.  UARTs transmit
 *  characters in order from LSB to MSB.  By storing the CRC this way
 *  we hand it to the UART in the order low-byte to high-byte; the UART
 *  sends each low-bit to hight-bit; and the result is transmission bit
 *  by bit from highest- to lowest-order term without requiring any bit
 *  shuffling on our part.  Reception works similarly
 *
 *  The feedback terms table consists of 256, 32-bit entries.  Notes
 *
 *      The table can be generated at runtime if desired; code to do so
 *      is shown later.  It might not be obvious, but the feedback
 *      terms simply represent the results of eight shift/xor opera
 *      tions for all combinations of data and CRC register values
 *
 *      The values must be right-shifted by eight bits by the "updcrc
 *      logic; the shift must be unsigned (bring in zeroes).  On some
 *      hardware you could probably optimize the shift in assembler by
 *      using byte-swap instructions
 *      polynomial $edb88320

 * implementation of MD5, SHA1, and AES is used and no external libraries are
 * required. When TLS is enabled (e.g., by enabling EAP-TLS or EAP-PEAP), the
 * crypto library used by the TLS implementation is expected to be used for
 * non-TLS needs, too, in order to save space by not implementing these
 * functions twice.
 *
 * Wrapper code for using each crypto library is in its own file (crypto*.c)
 * and one of these files is build and linked in to provide the functions

// Name:        lz.c
// Author:      Marcus Geelnard
// Description: LZ77 coder/decoder implementation.
// Reentrant:   Yes
// $ATH_LICENSE_NULL$
//
// The LZ77 compression scheme is a substitutional compression scheme
// proposed by Abraham Lempel and Jakob Ziv in 1977. It is very simple in
// its design, and uses no fancy bit level compression.
//
// This is my first attempt at an implementation of a LZ77 code/decoder.
//
// The principle of the LZ77 compression algorithm is to store repeated
// occurrences of strings as references to previous occurrences of the same
// string. The point is that the reference consumes less space than the
// string itself, provided that the string is long enough (in this
// implementation, the string has to be at least 4 bytes long, since the
// minimum coded reference is 3 bytes long). Also note that the term
// "string" refers to any kind of byte sequence (it does not have to be
// an ASCII string, for instance).
//
// The coder uses a brute force approach to finding string matches in the
// history buffer (or "sliding window", if you wish), which is very, very
// slow. I recon the complexity is somewhere between O(n^2) and O(n^3),
// depending on the input data.
//
// There is also a faster implementation that uses a large working buffer
// in which a "jump table" is stored, which is used to quickly find
// possible string matches (see the source code for LZ_CompressFast() for
// more information). The faster method is an order of magnitude faster,
// but still quite slow compared to other compression methods.
//
// The upside is that decompression is very fast, and the compression ratio
// is often very good.
//
// The reference to a string is coded as a (length,offset) pair, where the
// length indicates the length of the string, and the offset gives the
// offset from the current data position. To distinguish between string
// references and literal strings (uncompressed bytes), a string reference
// is preceded by a marker byte, which is chosen as the least common byte
// symbol in the input data stream (this marker byte is stored in the
// output stream as the first byte).
//
// Occurrences of the marker byte in the stream are encoded as the marker
// byte followed by a zero byte, which means that occurrences of the marker
// byte have to be coded with two bytes.
//
// The lengths and offsets are coded in a variable length fashion, allowing
// values of any magnitude (up to 4294967295 in this implementation).
//
// With this compression scheme, the worst case compression result is
// (257/256)*insize + 1.
